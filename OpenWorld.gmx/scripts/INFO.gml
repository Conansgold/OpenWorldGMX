Welcome to the Celstia Engine!

Celestia was a RPG that I worked on over two years but had to stop working on due to School.
Now I've released the assets for you to add to your games!

This script will go over the useful information to add anything here to your games!

In this engine most of the UI is based off of objects. All of the inventory slots and armor slots are objects.
I know this is rather stupid now but it works and it's kind of hard to change now.

All of the most used scripts are not in folders. These are the ones that you will be mainly editing to add items and stuff.
Most of the code for the dialog system and NPCs are in the parent and blank objects respectively.
Since most of the code is copied and pasted over and over I have commented the first part of most scripts. Everything else should be
self-explainitory based off of that.


Also remember, this asset is not just scripts! There are hundres of sprites that you can use in your game!
Anyways, I hope that you find something useful out of my work. I know that it's a bit messy but I tried my best cleaning it up.

Hope you like it!
